🌊 Drift Protocol Trading Bot
Automated algorithmic trading with disciplined risk management on Solana

📌 Overview

A high-frequency trading bot specializing in mean-reversion strategies for SOL-PERP markets on Drift Protocol. Designed for Web3-native markets, it combines:

On-chain liquidity analysis
CEX/DEX arbitrage detection
Institutional-grade risk controls
Built for traders who understand that 95% of retail bots fail—this one focuses on sustainable edge rather than hype.

✨ Core Principles

1. Market Philosophy

"Liquidity is the only truth" – All signals cross-verified with orderbook depth
SOL as base currency – Native integration with Solana’s speed/low fees
Anti-martingale – Position sizing scales with confidence, not losses
2. Technical Edge

📜 Why This Matters

Unlike 99% of crypto bots that:
❌ Backtest overfitting
❌ Ignore liquidity
❌ Use fixed stop-losses

This system implements real trading principles from Wall Street quant funds, adapted for SOL’s unique volatility profile.

Example Trade:
When SOL-PERP shows:

RSI < 30 (oversold)
Funding rate > 0.1% (shorts paying longs)
Orderbook liquidity > 10,000 SOL
→ Bot enters with 1.5x leverage, auto-exits at 2% profit or 1% loss.
